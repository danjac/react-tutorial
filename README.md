React learning site
===================

This is a very simple Hacker News/Reddit clone I've made to teach myself React. Therefore don't expect anything is going to work!

It's built with the following tech:

- ES6 + Babel
- io.js
- Koa
- React
- React-router
- Reflux
- Bootstrap
- Mongoose
- Mocha

Setup
-----

1. **npm install**
1. Create a *.env* file with the following settings:

        NODE_ENV=development
        SECRET_KEY=seekret

1. **babel-node server.js**
1. Open a browser at *localhost:3000* and you should be good to go.
